The small project that we would like you to work on, is to replicate the Bitfinex order books and trade history widget
UI on react/redux using https://docs.bitfinex.com/v2/docs websockets stream. Also it would be nice if you can show the
ticker as well.

There should also be a button that, once clicked, force closes the websocket connection, so you have to develop a proper
retry/reconnect/resubscribe logic.

If you have time also please create a basic chart, and it would be nice to see how you would make a minified version of
the project assets using webpack.

The documentation for the websockets are hopefully quite clear, but let us know if you have any questions!
