Some things the could be improved (if I had more time):
*) Split "dependencies and devDependencies" in package.json
*) Introduce better error handling when interacting with Websocket
*) Make better decomposition of React components
*) Create graphs

Other notes:
*) Most recent versions of the libraries were used including new React 16 and NPM 5
*) I believe resources minification is done with respect to the best practices. JS file is 178kb, gzipped version will
be ~50kb.
*) The need for "src/" prefix in imports can be easily eliminated by altering webpack configuration
*) I didn't focused too much on styles as we agreed
